"grammer-check" Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the Problem
   As a user so that I can improve my grammar, I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

2. Design the Method Signature

---

```ruby

def grammer_check(text)
return #correct
end

```

3. Create Examples as Tests

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

grammer_check("") or (1) => # raises an error
grammer_check("Hi, how are you?") => # returns correct


```

4. Implement the Behaviour
   Follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.

```

```
